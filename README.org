* Roadmap

** Axiom: Notification

** Real Server Watcher, that tells when system resumes from sleep

** Notify an object when a synth starts / ends

*** Do not notify end when a new synth is stared to replace a previous one

*** Examples with GUI buttons to start/stop a synth

** Unique objects - created only if not found under a key
